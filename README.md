## Design

### Agile Design
This app was developed using an Agile methodology. We utilized GitHub‚Äôs projects to manage user stories and prioritize the implementation of features based on their significance, ensuring the app‚Äôs functionality and user experience remained uncompromised.

Three categories were created indicating their level of importance, those were:

MUST HAVE
SHOULD HAVE
COULD HAVE

In addition, the user stories were divided according to their purpose:

EPIC1: Authentication
EPIC2: List-Create-Add-Delete-Tasks
EPIC3: Contact Form
EPIC4: Profile Edit
EPIC5: Other

The application of the AGILE methodology in this project enabled me to deliver a site that not only met all the necessary functionalities but also offered additional features. The time constraint on this project prevented the incorporation of all initially listed features, which is where the AGILE approach shines in app design. This is evident in the project, with completed User stories marked as ‚ÄòDone‚Äô and those earmarked for future implementation listed under the ‚ÄòFuture Implementations‚Äô section of the readme.

The GitHub Agile Project can be found here: https://github.com/users/Gavriil1/projects/6

### CRUD Functionality
Tick It handles data with full CRUD Functionality:

Create - Users can create, an account, profile, note, feedback message
Read - Users can view the notes, profile settings.
Update - Users can update their profile setting: password, username, avatar.
User can update notes
Delete - Users can delete notes

### Colours

The application employs a palette of bright yet neutral and warm colours, designed to evoke a sense of calm and allow users to focus on their notes without being distracted by other graphical elements. The background of the application is a light grey, complemented by a matching navigation bar. The main content is housed within white containers. Action buttons, text highlights, and the search bar are rendered in a contrasting darker shade. This colour scheme is consistently applied across all pages to ensure sufficient contrast and enhance user experience.

### Fonts

The website has been designed using Google Fonts. The ‚ÄúPoppins‚Äù font, with sans-serif as a fallback, was utilized across the site to guarantee the content‚Äôs readability.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  - React 

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios was employed as a promise-based HTTP client in the project. It was used to  send API requests from the React application to the API, effectively preventing any CORS errors during the transmission of cookies.
- [ClassNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames/) - ClassNames were used as "class" in standard css.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - The utilization of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was instrumental in precluding unauthenticated users from initiating superfluous network requests for access token renewal. Furthermore, it facilitated the elimination of the timestamp from the browser in instances where the token expired upon user refresh or the user opted to log out
- [React](https://17.reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building front end of the application. 
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) -  The Bootstrap React library was employed to construct the user interface on the front-end.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - This component was employed to enable the automatic loading of content to avoid pagination, so the user could see the content without distruptions
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - This library was used for dynamic routing.

## Front-End

### React

React.js, an open-source JavaScript library, was developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook). It serves as a powerful framework for creating interactive user interfaces and web applications more efficiently than using vanilla JavaScript. React‚Äôs focus on components allows developers to build reusable UI elements, making it a popular choice for single-page applications and beyond

I used React for this application for several reasons:

Flexibility: React‚Äôs modular structure makes its code easier to maintain compared to other front-end frameworks. 

Speed: When building sites or apps with React, the page loading speed significantly improves because the entire page doesn‚Äôt need to refresh and reload all components. Instead, components are updated dynamically, reducing wait times and enhancing the overall user experience.

React Bootstrap is an excellent choice for styling and ensuring responsiveness. It provides a collection of ready-to-use React components, significantly reducing the need to create commonly used code from scratch. With React Bootstrap, you can streamline your development process and enhance the user experience. 

React is the go-to library for developing social networking and media content applications. Notably, major platforms like Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb have all been built using React1. Its versatility and robustness make it a top choice for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.

Reusability of components ‚Äì Components can be created and re used throughout the app with no need to re write code for the same features.

## Validation 

### HTML
The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website. No errors were identified.

On all pages, we have the following error, which is related to the bug in FontAwesome library. Since we cannot adjust and change the FontAwesome library, I treat the error as a false positive:

"CSS: transform: var(--fa-rotate-angle, none) is not a transform value.
ate-angle,none))}.fa-stack{dis"

### Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse 

I used Lighthouse to test the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the site. Unfortunately, the performance is low.

This occurs because when React requests the user‚Äôs status, the API responds with a delay. As a result, even if the user is authenticated, the system initially loads the sign-in page and only then starts loading the notes page.

I confirmed that the cookies are configured as described in the walkthrough. I compressed the login image to 7 MB, but this did not improve the speed. I attempted to use this image from Cloudinary or directly from the React application, but the performance did not improve.

The issue could be related to the speed of the HEROKU student account. For this reason, I am ignoring  this error for the time being
 and reporting it as a bug

### Wave

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| When the React Front End sends a request to the API backend to query the authenticated user, the backend replies with a delay. This causes multiple issues. Performance issue: The page loads content for the unauthenticated user first and then for the authenticated user. This delay does not allow me to block unauthorized users from accessing the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù, ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù, and ‚ÄúContact Page‚Äù. This happens because even if the user is authenticated, a 404 page is loaded since the frontend receives the authenticated user details with a significant delay.Private information is not exposed, as I block the loading of notes for unauthorized users from the API." | The issue cannot be resolved. It could be due to the speed of the Heroku Student Account, or it could be a result of the design of the Code Institute walkthrough. I‚Äôve opened multiple cases with tutors, but we have been unable to solve the issue. |
| Lighthouse validation: Poor performance of the landing page | Resized (compressed) the landing image |
| Wave validator: Empty link | Add 'aria-label'|
| Wave validator: Footer has low contrast | Changed color to dark blue |
| Clicking on Logo image does not redirect the user to homepage | connected home url to Logo |
| The filter was not working on "Important" page | fixed typo in filter's url |
| Footer cover's page content on smaller screens | fixed it by adding style={{ marginBottom:  }} on each affected page. |
