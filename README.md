## Design

### Colours

The application employs a palette of bright yet neutral and warm colours, designed to evoke a sense of calm and allow users to focus on their notes without being distracted by other graphical elements. The background of the application is a light grey, complemented by a matching navigation bar. The main content is housed within white containers. Action buttons, text highlights, and the search bar are rendered in a contrasting darker shade. This colour scheme is consistently applied across all pages to ensure sufficient contrast and enhance user experience.

### Fonts

The website has been designed using Google Fonts. The ‚ÄúPoppins‚Äù font, with sans-serif as a fallback, was utilized across the site to guarantee the content‚Äôs readability.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  - React 

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios was employed as a promise-based HTTP client in the project. It was instrumental in sending API requests from the React application to the API, effectively preventing any CORS errors during the transmission of cookies.
- [ClassNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames/) -   This utility facilitates the modification of the website‚Äôs aesthetic elements contingent upon specific conditions. The rationale behind its implementation was to dynamically alter the visual representation of components in accordance with the required stylistic parameters, and to concurrently apply multiple styles to these components
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - The utilization of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was instrumental in precluding unauthenticated users from initiating superfluous network requests for access token renewal. Furthermore, it facilitated the elimination of the timestamp from the browser in instances where the token expired upon user refresh or the user opted to log out
- [React](https://17.reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building front end of the application. 
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) -  The Bootstrap React library was employed to construct the user interface on the front-end, encompassing both stylistic elements and responsiveness.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - This component was employed to facilitate the automatic loading of content, for instance, notes, as the user scrolls down the page. This effectively obviates the necessity for the user to manually navigate to subsequent or preceding pages.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - This library was leveraged for dynamic routing. It was instrumental in managing the transition between various component views and dictating the content visible to the user, contingent on the URL accessed in the browser.

### Tools & Programs

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Was used to check the responsiveness of a website.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) wireframes creation tool
- [Chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) was used for code debugging and for checking the responsiveness of a website
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) was used to store static files and images.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons sourced from Font Awesome were incorporated extensively across the website
- [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) - Icons from material UI were used in parallel to fontawesome.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Was used for font input.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) It served as a remote repository for the preservation of project code
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used to develop the application.
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) was used to deploy the project into live environment
- Validation:
  - [WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html
  - [Jigsaw W3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the css
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) used to validate JSX code
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) It was employed to ascertain the performance, accessibility, adherence to best practices, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the application.
  - [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) - It was employed to assess the accessibility of the application

## Front-End

### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state at any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of independent and reusable components ([source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795/)).

I used React for this application for several reasons:
- Speed - applying React significantly increases the page loading speed and reducing the wait, which affects user experience and satisfaction
- Flexibility - the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure, compared to other front-end frameworks
- React Bootstrap - excellent choice for improving user experience, used for styling and responsiveness. It comes with ready-to-use React built components. They are implemented with accessibility in mind, which is a vital factor when creating a front-end application. I used plain Bootstrap in my previous projects, so it was an easy choice to use React Bootstrap in this app.
- Most used library for developing social networking and media content applications - e.g. Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, etc.
- Reusability of components - no need to write various codes for the same features

There were various components created and reused across this application.

- `<NavBar />` - This is a reusable component that generates a navigation bar. It displays different options for logged-in and logged-out users. For logged-out users, it shows ‚ÄòSign In‚Äô and ‚ÄòSign Up‚Äô options. For logged-in users, it displays ‚ÄòNotes‚Äô, ‚ÄòImportant‚Äô, ‚ÄòContact Page‚Äô, ‚ÄòProfile Page‚Äô, and ‚ÄòSign Out‚Äô options
  - User stories covered: 

- `<Footer />` - This is a reusable component that generates a footer of the page. It has copyright information and social media links.
