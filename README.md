## Design

### Colours

The application employs a palette of bright yet neutral and warm colours, designed to evoke a sense of calm and allow users to focus on their notes without being distracted by other graphical elements. The background of the application is a light grey, complemented by a matching navigation bar. The main content is housed within white containers. Action buttons, text highlights, and the search bar are rendered in a contrasting darker shade. This colour scheme is consistently applied across all pages to ensure sufficient contrast and enhance user experience.

### Fonts

The website has been designed using Google Fonts. The ‚ÄúPoppins‚Äù font, with sans-serif as a fallback, was utilized across the site to guarantee the content‚Äôs readability.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  - React 

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios was employed as a promise-based HTTP client in the project. It was instrumental in sending API requests from the React application to the API, effectively preventing any CORS errors during the transmission of cookies.
- [ClassNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames/) -   This utility facilitates the modification of the website‚Äôs aesthetic elements contingent upon specific conditions. The rationale behind its implementation was to dynamically alter the visual representation of components in accordance with the required stylistic parameters, and to concurrently apply multiple styles to these components
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - The utilization of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was instrumental in precluding unauthenticated users from initiating superfluous network requests for access token renewal. Furthermore, it facilitated the elimination of the timestamp from the browser in instances where the token expired upon user refresh or the user opted to log out
- [React](https://17.reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building front end of the application. 
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) -  The Bootstrap React library was employed to construct the user interface on the front-end, encompassing both stylistic elements and responsiveness.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - This component was employed to facilitate the automatic loading of content, for instance, notes, as the user scrolls down the page. This effectively obviates the necessity for the user to manually navigate to subsequent or preceding pages.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - This library was leveraged for dynamic routing. It was instrumental in managing the transition between various component views and dictating the content visible to the user, contingent on the URL accessed in the browser.

### Tools & Programs

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Was used to check the responsiveness of a website.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) wireframes creation tool
- [Chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) was used for code debugging and for checking the responsiveness of a website
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) was used to store static files and images.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons sourced from Font Awesome were incorporated extensively across the website
- [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) - Icons from material UI were used in parallel to fontawesome.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Was used for font input.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) It served as a remote repository for the preservation of project code
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used to develop the application.
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) was used to deploy the project into live environment
- Validation:
  - [WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html
  - [Jigsaw W3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the css
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) used to validate JSX code
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) It was employed to ascertain the performance, accessibility, adherence to best practices, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the application.
  - [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) - It was employed to assess the accessibility of the application

## Front-End

<!-- ### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state at any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of independent and reusable components ([source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795/)).

I used React for this application for several reasons:
- Speed - applying React significantly increases the page loading speed and reducing the wait, which affects user experience and satisfaction
- Flexibility - the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure, compared to other front-end frameworks
- React Bootstrap - excellent choice for improving user experience, used for styling and responsiveness. It comes with ready-to-use React built components. They are implemented with accessibility in mind, which is a vital factor when creating a front-end application. I used plain Bootstrap in my previous projects, so it was an easy choice to use React Bootstrap in this app.
- Most used library for developing social networking and media content applications - e.g. Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, etc.
- Reusability of components - no need to write various codes for the same features

There were various components created and reused across this application.

- `<Asset />` - multipurpose reusable compontent which displays different versions of the component depending on the props we pass to it:
  - loading gif (spinner) when content is being loaded
  - image with src and alt attribute
  - paragraph with a message

  - User stories covered: 20

- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to render profile images in the UI. Passed props allow for setting image source and size and adjust image dimensions depending on where the component is rendered. Example of use include the `<NavBar />` component, Post page or the Profile page. On mobile screens Avatar component within the Profile Page will be significantly bigger than on other screen sizes.
  - User stories covered: 25, 26

- `<DropdownMenu />` - reusable component, used to render the dropdown menu which allows user to edit or delete their own posts orcomments, and also edit their profile or change profile password.
  - User stories covered: 16, 17, 27, 28

- `<FeedbackMsg />` - component for displaying feedback messages to the user upon editing/deleting comments, deleting post, updating profile information or a password.
  - User stories covered: 35

- `<Landing />` - specific component for displaying a landing page for new / not logged-in users, which contains links to sign up and log in, in addition to the navbar.
  - User stories covered: 1

- `<LikeFeedAddPost />` - reusable component containing 3 icons to add a post, show liked post or show posts by profiles the users follows. Displayed on various pages of the app.
  - User stories covered: 7, 21, 22

- `<NavBar />` - reusable component with the content depending on the login status of the user. For logged in user it shows icon link to the main posts page and user avatar/picture. For those who are not logged in, it displays icon links to sign up or log in instead of the avatar. The component is used on each page of the app.
  - User stories covered: 2, 3

- `<PageNotFound />` - specific component for displaying a 404 graphic error message with a return to menu button when user enters the url which does not exist.
  - User stories covered: 34

- `<PasswordCriteria />` - reusable component containing password criteria which are displayed on button hover or focus. Used on sign up page and profile password change page.
  - User stories covered: 4, 28

- `<PopularProfiles />` - reusable component showing first three most followed profiles in the app. The component displays user avatar, name and follow/unfollow button. These buttons are hidden on medium screen size devices. The component is used across the app together with the `<LikeFeedAddPost />` component and post categories badges on relevant pages.
  - User stories covered: 32 -->

### JSX
The JSX code was validated using the ESLint utility.
When initially installed and run on Gitpod, there were a few errors to address such as escaping a single quotes using ```&lsquo;``` and correcting empty block statements. After I've done the testing when I tried to run my project again with 'npm start' I encountered issues with version compatibility and settings (recorded in [here](docs/validation/eslint-issue.jpg)). I followed the instructions and deleted package-lock.json and removed eslint from dependencies.

As I didn't document the conducted tests, I decided to download my project and run it locally in Visual Studio Code editor. I installed the eslint package again and tested all js modules using command ```npx eslint yourfile.js```. See evidence of no errors shown below. Note: there were no feedback messages for no errors/warnings found.

- This application was created for the education purpose only. A majority of food photographs added as posts were found via Google Search Engine or added directly by each user testing the app. Due to extensive testing of this app, I'm not able to provide the sources of all of the pictures found via search engine. Please do not repost the images without crediting the source.


### Code

This project was inspired by the ['Moments'](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) social media platform which was a final walk-through project with Code Institute. I have built my own styles and added extra functionality, such as filtering of posts based on their category. The SnapFood application can be expanded on and include the potential improvements mentioned in the 'Future features / improvements' section.
