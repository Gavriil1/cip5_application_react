## Design

### Colours

The application employs a palette of bright yet neutral and warm colours, designed to evoke a sense of calm and allow users to focus on their notes without being distracted by other graphical elements. The background of the application is a light grey, complemented by a matching navigation bar. The main content is housed within white containers. Action buttons, text highlights, and the search bar are rendered in a contrasting darker shade. This colour scheme is consistently applied across all pages to ensure sufficient contrast and enhance user experience.

### Fonts

The website has been designed using Google Fonts. The ‚ÄúPoppins‚Äù font, with sans-serif as a fallback, was utilized across the site to guarantee the content‚Äôs readability.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  - React 

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios was employed as a promise-based HTTP client in the project. It was used to  send API requests from the React application to the API, effectively preventing any CORS errors during the transmission of cookies.
- [ClassNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames/) - ClassNames were used as "class" in standard css.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - The utilization of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was instrumental in precluding unauthenticated users from initiating superfluous network requests for access token renewal. Furthermore, it facilitated the elimination of the timestamp from the browser in instances where the token expired upon user refresh or the user opted to log out
- [React](https://17.reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building front end of the application. 
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) -  The Bootstrap React library was employed to construct the user interface on the front-end.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - This component was employed to enable the automatic loading of content to avoid pagination, so the user could see the content without distruptions
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - This library was used for dynamic routing. 

### Tools & Programs

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Was used to verify if the site is responsive
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used as wireframes creation tool
- [Chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) was used for code debugging and for checking the responsivenes of a website
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) It was used to store static files and images
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons sourced from Font Awesome were extensively incorporated across the website.
- [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) - Icons from Material UI were used in parallel to Font Awesome.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Was used for font input.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) Was used as a code repository.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used as IDE development tool
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) was used to deploy the project into live environment
- Validation:
  - [WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html
  - [Jigsaw W3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the css
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) used to validate JSX code
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) It was employed to verifying the performance, accessibility, adherence to best practices, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the application.
  - [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) - It was employed to assess the accessibility of the application

## Front-End

### React

React.js, an open-source JavaScript library, was developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook). It serves as a powerful framework for creating interactive user interfaces and web applications more efficiently than using vanilla JavaScript. React‚Äôs focus on components allows developers to build reusable UI elements, making it a popular choice for single-page applications and beyond

I used React for this application for several reasons:

Flexibility: React‚Äôs modular structure makes its code easier to maintain compared to other front-end frameworks. 

Speed: When building sites or apps with React, the page loading speed significantly improves because the entire page doesn‚Äôt need to refresh and reload all components. Instead, components are updated dynamically, reducing wait times and enhancing the overall user experience.

React Bootstrap is an excellent choice for styling and ensuring responsiveness. It provides a collection of ready-to-use React components, significantly reducing the need to create commonly used code from scratch. With React Bootstrap, you can streamline your development process and enhance the user experience. 

React is the go-to library for developing social networking and media content applications. Notably, major platforms like Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb have all been built using React1. Its versatility and robustness make it a top choice for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.

Reusability of components ‚Äì Components can be created and re used throughout the app with no need to re write code for the same features.

- `<NavBar />` - This is a reusable component that generates a navigation bar. It displays different options for logged-in and logged-out users. For logged-out users, it shows ‚ÄòSign In‚Äô and ‚ÄòSign Up‚Äô options.
